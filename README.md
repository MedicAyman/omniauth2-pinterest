NOTE: Unfortunately the API this library was created for never really existed. It was built against some API documentation that I think they accidentally released for about a week.

# OmniAuth Pinterest

This is the unofficial OmniAuth strategy for authenticating to Pinterest. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and Secret
on the [Pinterest Developer website](http://pinterest.com/developers/api).

## Basic Usage

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :pinterest, ENV['PINTEREST_ID'], ENV['PINTEREST_SECRET']
    end
